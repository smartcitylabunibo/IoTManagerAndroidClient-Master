## IoTManagerAndroidClient-Master ##
An Android Client for the IoT Manager framework (master repository)

## Synopsis ##
IoT Manager is a general framework which allows users to deal with heterogeneous sensor networks within the smart city context.
It is composed by a client component (front-end) which delivers useful information gathered by sensors (depending on the user's position and settings) and by a server component (back-end) which collects data from sensor networks and exposes them to the front-end.
The framework natively manages georeferencing from both the user's and the sensors' perspective.

## Usage ##
This repository contains an Android project implementing a client application for the IoT Manager framework.
Once installed, the client app can communicate with the framework's back-end to retrieve data collected by different sensors.

In order to address requests to the back-end correctly, the user needs to be provided with a valid username and the corresponding password.
These credentials are mainteined and granted by the [Smart City Lab](http://smartcity.csr.unibo.it) - Università di Bologna, Campus di Cesena, Italy.

This project has a strong teaching aim. Specifically, it is used as a training platform within the ["Smart City e Tecnologie Mobili"](http://smartcity.csr.unibo.it/smart-city-e-tecnologie-mobili/) master's degree course, held at the Università di Bologna, Campus di Cesena, [Corso di Laurea in Scienze e Tecnologie Informatiche](http://corsi.unibo.it/scienzetecnologieinformatiche/Pagine/default.aspx).

The IoTManagerAndroidClient-Student repository contains a limited version of the client which needs to be expanded and completed by students during the course classes.

This project relies on some existing libraries. Specifically:
- The graphical user interface relies on the MPAndroidChart project for what concerning charts. Please refer to [the project home page](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) for MPAndroidChart licence details.
- Maps features rely on [Google Maps API v2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/). In order to turn on these functionalities it is mandatory to fill the [strings.xml](/IoTManagerClientMain/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) file with a valid API Key.
